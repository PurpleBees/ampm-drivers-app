# AMPM DRIVER APP

### Overview
AMPM Driver App revolutionizes the delivery management process by providing an intuitive and efficient solution for delivery drivers. By leveraging the power of Supabase, an open-source Firebase alternative, the app ensures seamless authentication, real-time order tracking, and secure storage for delivery proof images. From logging in securely with OTP authentication to capturing proof of delivery, AMPM Driver App offers a complete package for delivery professionals to streamline their workflow and enhance customer satisfaction.

### Key Features

## OTP Authentication
With OTP (One-Time Password) authentication, AMPM Driver App ensures that only authorized users gain access to the app. This secure login method verifies the identity of drivers, safeguarding sensitive delivery information.

## Delivery Status Management
Managing delivery statuses is simplified with AMPM Driver App. Drivers can easily mark deliveries as completed or failed within the app, providing accurate updates to dispatchers and ensuring smooth communication throughout the delivery process.

## Proof of Delivery
Capturing proof of delivery is essential for verifying successful deliveries and resolving disputes. AMPM Driver App allows drivers to capture and store delivery proof images directly within the app using Supabase Storage. These images serve as concrete evidence of completed deliveries, fostering trust between drivers and customers.

## Clean Architecture (MVVM)
AMPM Driver App follows a clean architecture pattern with Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design, ensuring separation of concerns and promoting code maintainability, scalability, and testability. This architecture enhances the app's robustness and facilitates future development and updates.
